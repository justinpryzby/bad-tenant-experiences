In September, 2024, I rented the 2nd floor of a house at 3524 Park Avenue in
Minneapolis.
In late October, Lukas Thompson moved into the room on the 1st floor.
He told me that he worked "security" at the Up-Down arcade bar.
We had problems with him since the week he moved in.

As soon as he connected to my wifi, he started shouting at his video games.
2023-11-02: I hesitated to do it, but forced myself to tell him to quiet down,
since at that point it was after 10pm.
2023-11-25: I found the front doors left unlocked.
2023-11-28: I asked him at 11:52 pm to avoid shouting
2024-01-02: I asked him be quiet at 11:41 pm.
2024-01-07/8 Lukas was shouting until 01:40.  I gave up trying to
communicate with him about it, and sent future complaints directly to the
landlord.
2024-03-06: He had another outburst of noise between 4pm and 5pm, and I
disabled his internet access, which I'd been avoiding doing for months.

2023-12-12: I asked him clean up the dirty clean dishes left in the
sink/counter since 2023-12-04 (8 days)
2023-12-27: I asked him again to clean up 10 dirty clean dishes left in the
sink/counter since 2023-12-18 (9 days), and to clean the sink strainer of food
waste rather than leaving it behind.
2024-03-11: There were dirty dishes in the sink/counter until 2024-03-13 (3 days);
2024-03-14: There were dirty dishes in the sink/counter until 2024-03-21 (7 days);

2024-01-07: Lukas knowingly left the front door unlocked when he couldn't find his key.
2024-04-01: I found the front door unlocked;
2024-04-04: I found the front door unlocked, again;

2024-01-10: Lukas called me and woke me up at 4:12 AM when he didn't have his keys;
2024-01-20: Lukas called me and woke me up at 4:50 AM when he didn't have his keys;
2024-04-03: Lukas called me and woke me up at 3:25 AM when he didn't have his keys;

2023-12-24: Lukas removed a trash bag from his bedroom and left it on kitchen
floor overnight.
2024-03-06: Lukas removed 4 trash bags from his bedroom at once.
2024-03-08: Lukas removed several bags of trash from his room.  He put them
into the recycling bin rather than the trash bin.
2024-03-22: Lukas removed 8 pizza boxes from his bedroom at once.
2024-05-27: Lukas left the back door unlocked for 1.5 hours while taking out
numerous trash bags full of pizza boxes.  I finally locked it myself.

At the end of January, I started to smell cigarette smoke on the first floor,
and sometimes even from the 2nd floor.  This continued until the begining of
March, when I mentioned it to the landlord, who later told me that he'd asked
Lukas if he had been smoking in the house.  I didn't smell anything after that.
But I did occasionally see Lukas throw cigarette butts into the back yard.

2024-03-14: I noticed vegetables rotting in the refrigerator, leaking fluid.
I believe they'd been in the frigde since some time in January, when (I think)
Lukas' father bought them for him.  They remained in the fridge, rotting and
leaking, until 2023-04-04, when I asked him to do something with them.  Then,
he removed them to his kitchen trash, where they remained until the end of May.
I covered the trash to avoid rodents and flies and odors associated with rotting
food, especially when it's left unrefrigerated.

2024-05-02: Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension executed a search
warrant at the house, with Lukas Michael Thompson (DOB 08/22/2000) as the
target of their investigation.  They confiscated his desktop computer, an
external hard drive, and his smartphone (#612-720-4209).  For details contact:
special agent Craig Martin (651-793-1045) or the 4th District Court, Hennepin
County.

2024-05-03(?): The landlord gave him a 30 days notice to vacate the premise.

I found another phone number for Lukas on the outside of a pizza box in the
fridge.  612-759-2037.  I'm aware of a couple more contact info (because he was
connected to my comcast account).  xh0110w0n3x@gmail.com
